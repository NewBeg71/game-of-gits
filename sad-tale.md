House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.


The above is a total lie, Ned dies at the end of Season 1 wrongfully declared a traitor by the bastard king Joffrey Borathean.


HE GETS BEHEADED.

Demonstrating unstaging.
